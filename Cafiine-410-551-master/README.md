# Cafiine-410-551
A Cafiine version that allows you to choose your IP on the page, rather than compile it. Works from 4.1.0 to 5.5.1.

# What is this?
Cafiine is almost like RiiFS from the Wii. It's able to transfer files from a computer and bring them over to the WiiU and apply them over current files. So really, it's an application that allows game mods to happen.

# How to set up
First, you want to download this repo. You can either clone it, or download it as a ZIP. If you just want to run it and not compile, go into the installer/bin folder and choose the codeXXX.bin, where XXX is your firmware version. To check this, go into your WiiU's system settings. It should be on the top left corner.

Next, place the bin file where you usually put the bin files with the kernel exploit. (Found somewhere else.) 

# Running Cafiine
You want to download the server with this as well. If you downloaded the repo, or cloned it, it should be located in /server. 

First, you want to run the kernel exploit. After that exits, load up the bin file that you placed earlier. It should load with a IPv4 and cup of coffee. 

You want to input your IPv4 into the program. For windows users, simply go into command and type in "ipconfig" or "ipconfig -all". It should be there. For Mac users, it should be "ifconfig -a".

Move the arrows around with the D-Pad, and use the Up/Down D-pad buttons to set the 4 numbers to your IP.

Have fun!
